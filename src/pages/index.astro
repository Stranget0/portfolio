				We have a fantastic little sky! Let's put some happy little bushes on
				the other side now. Take your time. Speed will come later. Look at them
				little rascals. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. You
				can create anything that makes you happy. Just let go - and fall like a
				little waterfall. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. We don't have
				anything but happy trees here. Let's build some happy little clouds up
				here. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. We need dark
				in order to show light. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Maybe there's
				a happy little bush that lives right there. Maybe we got a few little
				happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We'll put all the little
				clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Only God can make a
				tree - but you can paint one. This is a fantastic little painting.
				Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can
				do anything. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them
				in your mind first. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes
				in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. A big
				strong tree needs big strong roots. Volunteering your time; it pays you
				and your whole community fantastic dividends. Just make little strokes
				like that. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Van
				Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.
				We'll have a super time. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.
