	"We have a fantastic little sky! Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Take your time. Speed will come later. Look at them little rascals. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. You can create anything that makes you happy. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. We need dark in order to show light. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. This is a fantastic little painting. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Just make little strokes like that. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. We'll have a super time. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.";
