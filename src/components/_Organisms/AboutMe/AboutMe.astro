				Learn when to stop. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? This is a fantastic little painting. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.
				
				Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. This piece of canvas is your world.
				
				Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy.
				
				It's cold, but it's beautiful. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.
				
				It takes dark in order to show light. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. There are no limits in this world. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.`}
